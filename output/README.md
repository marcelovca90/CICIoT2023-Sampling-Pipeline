# Results Folder - Disclaimer

The results in this folder have been compressed in ZIP format because the original Jupyter Notebook output files are very large due to extensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) logging.

### How to Access the Results:
1. Extract the ZIP files using any standard decompression tool.
2. Open the extracted files in a Jupyter Notebook or a compatible viewer.
3. If you encounter issues loading large files, consider using a machine with sufficient RAM or processing power.

### Purpose of These Results:
- These files serve mainly as supplementary examples, providing additional details beyond the main manuscript.
- They can be used to check per-class results, inspect intermediate outputs, and validate the model performance across different classification tasks.
- For a summary of key results, refer to the tables and figures in the main manuscript.

### File Integrity Verification:
To ensure the integrity of the downloaded files, you can verify the SHA-256 checksums.

### Expected SHA-256 Checksums:
